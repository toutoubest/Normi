# psedoScore.py, mRMR.py

Some distance based scores funcs are in here

# Evaluate.py:
some auroc and auprc definition

# mRMR.py
This script implements the divergence-based mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) algorithm for network inference. The core function MRMR2_divergence selects informative and non-redundant gene interactions by balancing mutual relevance scores and redundancy, with a sparsity-controlling regularization parameter lambda_val.

# run_slingshot_distance_example.py: 
this is the example code using slingshot and some distanced based score

# run_4new pseudo_methods_example.py:
this is the example code uing 4 new pseudotime methods(diffmap, phate,paga,pca) and some distance based score.
